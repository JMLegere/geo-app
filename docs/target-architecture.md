# Target Architecture

> The definitive design doc for EarthNova. Not aspirational — this is what we're building. Supersedes `architecture.md` (current state), `engine-architecture.md` (engine phases), `ideal-architecture.md` (server-authoritative), and `current-architecture.md`. Those docs remain as historical reference. This doc is the source of truth.

## 5 Pillars

Every line of code serves exactly one of these. If it doesn't, it's dead weight.

| # | Pillar | What | Core Modules |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **🗺️ Explore** | Move through the real world, reveal fog-of-war | `core/game_loop/`, `features/map/`, `features/exploration/` |
| 2 | **🔬 Discover** | Encounter species, roll items, build collection | `core/species/`, `features/discovery/` |
| 3 | **🎒 Collect** | Sanctuary, achievements, restoration, caretaking | `features/collection/` |
| 4 | **☁️ Persist** | Auth, local DB, sync, daily seed | `features/auth/`, `features/sync/`, `core/persistence/`, `core/database/` |
| 5 | **📡 Observe** | Structured events, session timelines, fleet health, performance budgets | `core/engine/` (GameEvent stream), `app_events` table |

### Observability Is Not Optional

Observability is not a logging add-on. It's the event stream that IS the game. Every state change — cell entered, species discovered, fog updated, error caught — is a `GameEvent`. The same stream drives:
- **Gameplay** — UI subscribes to events and renders them
- **Persistence** — event consumers write to SQLite + write queue
- **Analytics** — events flush to `app_events` table in Supabase
- **Debugging** — session timelines reconstructable from events
- **Performance** — timing events track frame budgets and latency

One stream. Multiple consumers. No separate logging system for structured data.

---

## Hardware Budgets

These are constraints, not guidelines. The architecture must satisfy them.

### Memory Budget (target: <80 MB total app)

| Resource | Budget | Strategy |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Species catalog | 0 MB in RAM | Pre-compiled SQLite. Query on demand. Never parse JSON at runtime. |
| Species working set | 5 MB (~2K objects) | LRU cache for loot table candidates. Evict least-recently-used. |
| Item instances | 10 MB | Paginate collection views. Load 50 at a time. |
| Cell cache | 500 cells | Ring buffer. Evict farthest cells when full. |
| Fog render cache | Viewport only | Raster image, fixed resolution. No per-cell objects. |
| Map tile cache | 50 tiles | MapLibre default. Cap via config. |
| Event buffer | 2 MB | 500-line ring buffer (DebugLogBuffer) + batched flush (30s). |

### Frame Budget (target: 60fps, 16.6ms per frame)

| Stage | Budget | Enforced By |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Flutter framework (layout, paint) | 4 ms | Framework |
| Map tile compositing (MapLibre) | 4 ms | MapLibre |
| Fog + cell overlay rendering | 4 ms | Raster overlay (constant cost) |
| Headroom (GC, jank, unexpected) | 4.6 ms | Architecture |

**Rule:** No synchronous computation >8ms on the main thread. If it takes longer, it runs in the engine (background) or gets chunked.

### Battery Budget

| Mode | GPS Rate | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Walking (active play) | 1 Hz | Default when app is foregrounded |
| Stationary (no movement 30s) | 0.1 Hz | Displacement filter detects no movement |
| Background | OFF | iOS/Android lifecycle. No background GPS. |
| Web | N/A | Step-based only. No GPS. |

### Storage Budget

| Table | Growth Rate | Retention |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| item_instances | ~3 rows/day | Permanent |
| cell_progress | ~10 rows/day | Permanent |
| app_events | ~200 rows/session | 30 days (performance events: 7 days) |
| species_definitions | Static | Pre-compiled, read-only |
| write_queue | Transient | Deleted after server confirms |

### Rendering Principles — The GBA Rule

> If GameFreak could run Pokemon Fire Red at 60fps on a 16MHz Game Boy Advance
> with 256KB RAM, we can run EarthNova at 60fps on a 2GHz mobile browser with
> gigabytes of RAM. When we can't, the problem is wasted work, not the platform.

The GBA achieved 60fps by never doing work that doesn't change the screen this
frame. No off-screen precomputation, no speculative caching, no background
widget reconciliation. If a sprite isn't on screen, it doesn't exist in memory.
If a tile hasn't changed, it isn't redrawn.

**Core constraint: never do work that doesn't change a pixel visible to the user
this frame.** Every violation costs frame budget on mobile web, where CanvasKit +
WebKit already consume ~4ms of baseline overhead.

#### 5 Rules

| # | Rule | Violation | Fix |
|---|------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **Only compute fog for visible cells** | Rebuilding GeoJSON for 6000+ cells when ~30 are on screen | Viewport-scoped fog: build GeoJSON only for cells in the current viewport, not the entire discovered set |
| 2 | **Only build the active tab** | `IndexedStack` keeps all 4 tab widget trees alive simultaneously | Lazy tab construction: build on select, dispose on deselect. The Pokedex doesn't exist in memory while you're walking around. |
| 3 | **Resolve eagerly, render lazily** | Detection zone resolves 6000+ cells synchronously in one frame, blocking UI | Resolve the full district in batched chunks (yield every 50). Render only the viewport subset. Game logic needs spatial awareness of the full zone; the GPU only needs to draw what's on screen. |
| 4 | **Only animate what's visible** | `PrismaticAnimationScope` ticks every frame even when Pack tab is hidden | Gate animations on tab visibility. If the user can't see it, don't compute it. |
| 5 | **Only allocate strings when state changes** | Fog GeoJSON rebuilt as new String objects every 500ms even when no cells changed | Cache GeoJSON strings. Only rebuild when the visible cell set or fog states actually change. MapLibre v0.1.2 only supports full source replacement — so minimize rebuild frequency, not granularity. |

#### Implementation Phases

| Phase | Change | Waste eliminated | Effort |
|-------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| A | Lazy tabs — replace `IndexedStack` with builder that constructs/disposes on tab switch | 3 invisible tab widget trees + animation controllers ticking | S |
| B | Viewport-scoped fog — `_buildGeoJson()` filters to cells in camera viewport | GeoJSON for 6000 cells when 30 are visible | M |
| C | Pre-decoded image atlas — decode species icons during hydration, not on scroll | Image load/decode/dispose churn (28 loads + 27 disposes per minute) | L |
| D | Visibility-gated animation — stop `PrismaticAnimationScope` controller when Pack tab not active | AnimationController ticking 60fps for invisible tab | S |

## Directory Structure

14 features, organized by role. Each is a distinct concept you can name in one word.

**The test:** Can you name it and a user would understand? If yes, it's a feature. If not, it's infrastructure and belongs in `core/` or `shared/`.

### Feature Roles

| Role | Features | What they do |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Inputs** | `location/`, `world/`, `calendar/`, `weather/`, `steps/` | Real-world data that feeds the game loop |
| **Domain** | `items/` | Core game state — item definitions, instances, inventory, lifecycle |
| **Experiences** | `map/`, `discovery/`, `pack/`, `sanctuary/`, `achievements/`, `caretaking/` | What the player sees and interacts with |
| **Infrastructure** | `auth/`, `sync/`, `onboarding/` | Identity, persistence, first-run |

### What Moved

| Current Location | Target Location | Rationale |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| `features/biome/` | `features/world/` | Biome is one aspect of "what's here" — terrain type |

| `features/seasonal/` | `features/calendar/` | Seasons are one aspect of "when" — grows into time-of-day, daily schedule |
| `features/enrichment/` (1 file) | `features/sync/` | Not a concept. The enrichment service already lives in sync/. |
| `features/navigation/` | `main.dart` | Not a concept. TabShell is app infrastructure. |
| `core/cells/cell_property_resolver.dart` | `features/world/` | Cell property resolution is world state, not grid geometry |
| `core/cells/event_resolver.dart` | `features/world/` | Cell events (migration, nesting) are world state |
| `core/game/` + `core/engine/` | `core/engine/` | One game loop module |

### Items as Independent Entities

Items exist independently of where they are. An item has a **location**, not a status. The location is a real place in the game.

#### Item Locations

| Location | Where the item is | Held? | Viewed by |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-----------|
| `pack` | On the player, in their field pack | Yes | `pack/` |
| `sanctuary` | Placed in the player's sanctuary | Yes | `sanctuary/` |
| `museum` | Donated to the museum (permanent) | No — gone | `museum/` |
| `wild` | Released back into the world | No — gone | — |
| `trade` | In transit to another player | No — pending | — |

**Held** = the player still possesses the item and can move it. Museum, wild, and trade are one-way — the item leaves the player's possession.

Moving an item is changing its location. No transfer logic, no container management:
- `pack → sanctuary` — player places item in sanctuary
- `sanctuary → pack` — player retrieves item from sanctuary
- `pack → museum` — permanent donation (irreversible)
- `pack → wild` — release (irreversible)
- `pack → trade` — offer to another player (irreversible once accepted)

**`items/` owns all item state** — definitions, instances, creation, stats, location, lifecycle. Single source of truth for every item regardless of where it currently is.

**`pack/` and `sanctuary/` are pure views.** They query items by location and render them. They own zero item state.

**`world/` is shared state.** Same cell = same terrain, events for all players. No userId.

**`items/` is per-player state.** Each player's items are their own. userId on every row.

| State | Scope | Owner | Tables |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| World | All players | `world/` | `cell_properties`, `location_nodes`, `species_definitions` |
| Items | Per-player | `items/` | `item_instances`, `player_profile` |
| Events | Per-session | `core/engine/` | `app_events` |

### What's Deleted

| Item | Lines | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| `H3CellService` | ~200 | Never used. H3 fallback that never fell back. |
| `VoronoiCellService` | ~200 | Replaced by LazyVoronoi. Dead code. |
| Legacy Voronoi constants (lines 94–114) | 21 | Zero references outside constants.dart. |

**`CellService` interface stays.** LazyVoronoi is the only implementation, but the interface is used by GameCoordinator, FogStateResolver, CellCache, and every test mock. Testability is worth the abstraction.

## Species Data: Pre-Compiled SQLite

**Decision: Ship a compiled `.db` file, not a JSON file parsed at runtime.**

### Build Pipeline

```
assets/species_data.json  (source of truth, git-tracked, human-readable)
        │
        ▼
tool/compile_species_db.dart  (build script, runs pre-build)
        │
        ▼
assets/species.db  (pre-compiled SQLite, shipped in APK bundle)
        │
        ▼
SpeciesRepository  (queries SQLite directly, no parsing)
```

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE species_definitions (
  scientific_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  common_name     TEXT NOT NULL,
  taxonomic_class TEXT NOT NULL,
  iucn_status     TEXT NOT NULL,
  habitats_json   TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON array: ["Forest","Mountain"]
  continents_json TEXT NOT NULL    -- JSON array: ["Asia"]
);

CREATE INDEX idx_species_habitat ON species_definitions (iucn_status);
```

### Runtime API

```dart
class SpeciesRepository {
  final Database _db;

  /// Query candidates for loot table.
  /// Returns only species matching current habitat + continent + season.
  Future<List<FaunaDefinition>> getCandidates({
    required Set<Habitat> habitats,
    required Continent continent,
    required Season season,
  });

  /// Lookup a single species by scientific name.
  Future<FaunaDefinition?> getByScientificName(String name);

  /// Count total species (for stats display).
  Future<int> count();
}
```

### What This Replaces

| Current | Target |
|---------|--------|
| `SpeciesDataLoader` — parses 6 MB JSON at startup | `SpeciesRepository` — queries pre-compiled SQLite |
| `speciesDataProvider` — FutureProvider holding `List<FaunaDefinition>` | `speciesRepositoryProvider` — Provider holding `SpeciesRepository` |
| `SpeciesService` — filters in-memory list | `LootTable` — queries `SpeciesRepository` for candidates |
| 33K Dart objects in RAM (~40–60 MB) | 0 objects in RAM. LRU cache holds ≤2K working set. |

---

## Fog Rendering: Raster Overlay + Vector Boundaries

**Decision: Fog is a raster image. Cell boundaries are vector lines. Two independent layers.**

### Fog Layer (raster)

- Full-viewport bitmap overlay on the map
- Each pixel's alpha = fog opacity at that world position
- Revealing fog = setting pixels to transparent
- Updated only when fog state changes (not every frame, not on camera pan)
- One draw call. Cost is O(viewport), not O(explored cells).
- Scales infinitely — 10,000 explored cells costs the same as 10.

### Cell Boundary Layer (vector)

- GeoJSON line features for Voronoi cell edges
- Only rendered for cells within viewport + small buffer (~50–100 cells)
- Thin lines, no fill polygons
- Updated on camera pan (debounced 200ms)

### What This Replaces

| Current | Target |
|---------|--------|
| GeoJSON fill polygon per cell (fog + boundary combined) | Raster overlay (fog) + GeoJSON lines (boundaries) |
| Cost grows with explored cells | Cost fixed to viewport size |
| Rebuild on every camera move | Fog: rebuild on state change only. Lines: debounced 200ms. |
| `FogOverlayController` builds GeoJSON | `FogRasterRenderer` renders to bitmap |

---

## Observability Architecture

### The Event Stream

Every game state change is a `GameEvent` with a fat envelope:

```dart
class GameEvent {
  final String sessionId;     // UUID v4, per app launch
  final String? userId;       // Supabase auth user ID
  final String deviceId;      // SHA-256 fingerprint (12 chars)
  final DateTime timestamp;   // UTC
  final String category;      // state | user | system | performance
  final String event;         // cell_entered, species_discovered, etc.
  final Map<String, dynamic> data;  // all context, no joins needed
}
```

### Event Catalog

See `engine-architecture.md` § Event Catalog for the full list. Key events:

| Category | Events |
|----------|--------|
| **State** | cell_entered, cell_exited, species_discovered, fog_changed, seed_rotated, enrichment_complete |
| **User** | session_started, session_ended, tab_switched, cell_tapped |
| **System** | hydration_complete, auth_restored, auth_expired, network_error, crash |
| **Performance** | fog_computed, geojson_built, api_call, sqlite_op |

### Event Flow

```
GameEngine emits GameEvent
  │
  ├─→ UI (MapScreen, toasts, overlays) — gameplay rendering
  ├─→ PersistenceConsumer — SQLite writes + write queue
  ├─→ EventSink — batch flush to app_events (30s / on background)
  └─→ Provider projections — fog, inventory, player state for widgets
```

### Persistence

Two destinations:

| Destination | Table | Retention | Purpose |
|-------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| Local SQLite | `app_events` | Session lifetime | Offline debugging, session reconstruction |
| Supabase | `app_events` | 30 days (perf: 7 days) | Fleet health, analytics, dashboards |

### Dashboard Queries (ready to use)

```sql
-- Session timeline
SELECT event, data, created_at FROM app_events
WHERE session_id = '<id>' ORDER BY created_at;

-- Crash rate per hour
SELECT date_trunc('hour', created_at), count(*)
FROM app_events WHERE event = 'crash'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 24;

-- P95 hydration time
SELECT percentile_cont(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (data->>'duration_ms')::int)
FROM app_events WHERE event = 'hydration_complete';

-- Daily active users
SELECT date_trunc('day', created_at), count(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM app_events WHERE event = 'session_started'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

### Error Firewall

The engine never throws to the UI. All errors become events:
- Network failure → `network_error` event → engine continues, queue writes
- Auth expired → `auth_expired` event → engine pauses, UI shows re-auth
- SQLite failure → `crash` event → engine attempts recovery
- Asset load failure → `crash` event → fall back to cached data

## Web Platform

Web is a dev/test platform. Not a product target.

**Build for mobile. Tolerate web. Stop investing in web-specific code.**

- Web uses step-based exploration (no GPS)
- Web uses main-thread engine runner (no isolate)
- Web uses WASM SQLite via Drift (accept the performance hit)
- No web-specific optimizations, no web-specific features
- Existing platform splits (`_web.dart` / `_native.dart`) stay where they exist but don't grow

---

## Game Loop Pipeline

Event-driven. Not timer-driven.

```
GPS (1 Hz, displacement-filtered)
  │
  ▼
RubberBandController (60fps vsync, main thread)
  │ interpolated position (10Hz throttled)
  ▼
EngineRunner.send(PositionUpdate)
  │
  ▼
GameEngine._processGameLogic()
  ├── Cell resolution (LazyVoronoi, cached)
  ├── Fog computation (from position + visit history)
  ├── Encounter check (only on NEW cell entry)
  │     └── Species roll (SHA-256 deterministic, queries SpeciesRepository)
  ├── Emit GameEvents (cell_entered, fog_changed, species_discovered)
  └── Observability (timing events for each stage)
  │
  ▼
Event Consumers (provider layer)
  ├── PersistenceConsumer → SQLite + write queue
  ├── Provider projections → UI state (fog, inventory, player)
  └── EventSink → app_events (batched)
```

### Adaptive Tick Rate

The game loop doesn't run on a fixed timer. It processes when there's input:

- **Position update** → full pipeline (cell → fog → encounter → events)
- **Cell tap** → cell info lookup → event
- **Auth change** → hydration or pause → event
- **App lifecycle** → flush events, pause/resume GPS

When the player is stationary, nothing processes. Zero CPU, zero battery.

## Principles

1. **Features are user journeys.** If a user can't point at it on screen, it's not a feature. It's infrastructure and belongs in `core/`.

2. **The engine is a firewall.** Errors inside become events, not exceptions. Nothing propagates to the UI. Nothing cascades. Nothing kills the widget tree.

3. **Everything is an event.** A discovery, a cell visit, an error, a hydration completion — same shape, same stream. The event stream IS observability, sync, and state.

4. **Hardware budgets are constraints.** 80 MB RAM. 16.6ms frame. 0 MB for species in memory. These aren't targets — they're ceilings.

5. **No prototyping shortcuts.** Pre-compiled SQLite, not parsed JSON. Raster fog, not polygon-per-cell. One cell implementation, not three. The right solution, not the quick one.

6. **The map is a dumb renderer.** It receives events and draws them. No game logic, no state management, no persistence. Just pixels.

7. **Ship the compiled artifact.** Species data, biome data, any large dataset — compile to SQLite at build time. Parse text at build time. Query binary at runtime.

8. **Web is dev/test.** Build for mobile phones. Tolerate web browsers. Don't optimize for web.

## Migration Path (Current → Target)

### Phase 0: Decompose `game_coordinator_provider.dart`

This 1,832-line file is the actual architecture. It imports from 30+ modules, hydrates 4 data sources, wires 10+ callbacks, manages auth, triggers enrichment, and handles persistence. Every subsequent phase touches this file. Decompose it first.

| Action | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Extract hydration logic into `HydrationService` | 2 hr |
| Extract persistence wiring into `PersistenceConsumer` | 2 hr |
| Extract enrichment wiring into `EnrichmentConsumer` | 1 hr |
| Slim provider to: create engine, wire consumers, expose coordinator | 1 hr |

**Result:** Provider file drops from 1,832 lines to ~300. Each consumer is independently testable.

### Phase A: Dead Code + Feature Reorganization

Delete dead code. Reorganize features. Create new concept features. Zero behavior change.

| Action | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Delete H3CellService, VoronoiCellService, legacy constants | 1 hr |
| Fold `enrichment/` (1 file) → `sync/providers/` | 30 min |
| Move `seasonal/` → `features/calendar/` (new feature) | 1 hr |
| Move `biome/` + `restoration/` + cell property resolver + event resolver → `features/world/` (new feature) | 2 hr |
| Move `navigation/` TabShell → `main.dart` or `shared/` | 1 hr |
| Create `features/items/` (extract item services + providers from core/state/) | 2 hr |
| Merge `core/game/` into `core/engine/` | 1 hr |
| Update all import paths + tests + AGENTS.md files | 3 hr |

**Result:** 16 → 14 features. 2 non-concepts folded (enrichment, navigation). 3 new concept features created (calendar, world, items). Dead code deleted. Import paths stabilized before heavier phases.

### Phase B: Species SQLite

Replace in-memory JSON parsing with pre-compiled SQLite.

| Action | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Write `tool/compile_species_db.dart` build script | 2 hr |
| Create `species_definitions` table schema | 30 min |
| Create `SpeciesRepository` (query interface) | 2 hr |
| Create `SpeciesCache` (LRU, 2K cap) | 1 hr |
| Rewire `LootTable` to query `SpeciesRepository` | 2 hr |
| Delete `SpeciesDataLoader`, `speciesDataProvider` | 30 min |
| Update tests | 2 hr |

**Result:** 0 MB species in RAM. Startup time drops. 33K species queryable in <1ms.

### Phase C: Fog Rendering

**Current state:** Two fog renderers already exist:
1. `FogCanvasPainter` — Canvas compositing (raster-like, already implemented)
2. `FogGeoJsonBuilder` — 3-layer native GeoJSON via MapLibre

**Decision needed:** Profile both. Pick the one with better frame budget numbers. If neither meets the 4ms fog budget, then build a MapLibre `ImageSource` raster overlay. Don't build a third renderer without evidence the existing two fail.

| Action | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Profile `FogCanvasPainter` vs `FogGeoJsonBuilder` (measure frame times) | 2 hr |
| Pick winner, delete loser | 1 hr |
| If neither meets budget: build `ImageSource` raster overlay | 4 hr |
| Separate cell boundary lines from fog fill (regardless of approach) | 1 hr |
| Wire fog state changes → regeneration only on state change (not camera pan) | 1 hr |

**Result:** Fog rendering cost fixed to viewport size. Scales to unlimited explored cells.

### Phase D: Observability Completion

Engine event foundation exists (Phases 1–5 of engine-architecture.md, partially done). Complete it.

| Action | Effort |
|--------|--------|
| Event emission from all coordinator callbacks (complete coverage) | 2 hr |
| EventSink batch flush to `app_events` (30s + on background) | 2 hr |
| Performance timing events (fog, GeoJSON, SQLite, API) | 2 hr |
| Local `app_events` SQLite table for offline sessions | 1 hr |
| Dashboard query templates (session timeline, crash rate, DAU) | 1 hr |

**Result:** Full observability. Any session reconstructable. Fleet health queryable.

### Phase Order

```
Phase A (consolidation) — no dependencies, safe, immediate
    ↓
Phase B (species SQLite) — independent of C and D
Phase C (raster fog) — independent of B and D
Phase D (observability) — independent of B and C
```

B, C, D are independent and can be worked in any order or in parallel.

## What Stays Unchanged

These are already correct:

- **`core/models/`** — 24 immutable value objects, sealed classes
- **`core/database/`** — Drift ORM, schema version 13
- **`core/persistence/`** — 7 repositories, clean abstractions
- **`core/fog/`** — Computed fog from position + visits, never persisted
- **Deterministic encounters** — SHA-256(dailySeed + cellId), daily rotation
- **Server-authoritative** — Supabase source of truth, SQLite cache + write queue
- **Riverpod v3 Notifier pattern** — consistent, correct
- **`shared/`** — Design tokens, theme, constants
- **GameEvent model** — envelope with sessionId, userId, deviceId, category, event, data
- **Engine firewall** — errors become events, never exceptions
- **Write queue** — debounced, batched, retry with backoff

## Open Issues

Issues identified during architecture review that need resolution before or during implementation.

| # | Issue | Impact | Resolution |
|---|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Species SQLite on web**: WASM SQLite can't open a pre-compiled `.db` asset the same way native can. Web may need a different loading path or first-run import. | Blocks Phase B for web | Acceptable — web is dev/test only. Build for native, tolerate web. |
| 2 | **`world/` naming**: Users don't think "world." Closer to infrastructure. But it IS shared state that's distinct from player state. | Naming clarity | Open — keep `world/` or rename to `terrain/` or `environment/` |
| 3 | **Species SQLite build integration**: When does `compile_species_db.dart` run? CI? Local? Is the `.db` committed or generated? | Phase B implementation detail | Decide during Phase B. Likely: generated in CI, committed as asset. |
| 4 | **LootTable async migration**: Current LootTable takes `List<FaunaDefinition>` synchronously. SQLite queries are async. Every call site that builds a LootTable breaks. | Phase B complexity | LootTable must pre-fetch candidates async, then roll synchronously from the cached set. |
| 5 | **EventSink error recovery**: What happens when Supabase is unreachable for days? Local `app_events` grows unbounded? | Phase D reliability | Add retention cap to local events (e.g., 10K rows). Accept data loss for old events. |
| 6 | **GameEvent volume**: Fog changes at 10Hz when walking. 36K events/hour would flood the buffer. | Phase D design | NOT all fog changes are events. Only fog STATE TRANSITIONS (unexplored → observed) are events, not every recomputation. |
